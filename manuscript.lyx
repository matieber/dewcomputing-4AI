Gradually,
 
\change_unchanged
AI is becoming ubiquitous at the network edge.
 The wide availability of pre-trained models and AI execution frameworks are,
 in part,
 responsible of such ubiquity.
 Particularly,
 deep neural networks (DNL) such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) are extensively used in computer vision (CV) for performing object recognition and image classification tasks.
 Solutions in various domains ranging from security surveillance to e-health

 In many cases,
 such solutions must

 real-time inferences and some progress has been made in this respect.
 Some approaches show a strong dependency on Cloud resources as complement to the computing power that resource limited edge nodes can offer.
 Other solutions distribute workload horizontally,
 i.e.,
 by harnessing the power of several edge nodes within the same LAN or WLAN.
 Many of these efforts experiment with real settings comprising SBC-like

\change_unchanged
edge nodes only such as NVidia Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi,
 and few of these consider nomadic hardware such as smartphones as edge nodes.
 Given the ubiquity of smartphones worldwide and the unlimited scenarios where clusters of these nodes can be exploited for providing su

stantial computing power,
 in this work,
 we shed some light in answering the following question:
 Is smartphone-based edge computing a competitive resource provider for real-time AI inferences?
 We evaluate the potential of smartphone clusters for making real-time inferences associated to CV tasks based on intuitive image/video partitioning schemes.
 In our experiments we use three pre-trained DNL models that present different computing requirements and eight heterogeneous edge nodes including five low/mid-end smartphones and three SBCs.
 We compared the performance achieved using workloads 
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738241517
that simulate
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738241517
from
\change_unchanged
 three image stream processing scenarios with different characteristics.
 Experiments were run with the help of a tool set 
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738241541
specially 
\change_unchanged
designed for reproducing battery-driven edge computing tests.
 We compared the 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738241552
task 
\change_unchanged
throughput achieved by using either several smartphone clusters testbeds or SBCs only.
 Additionally,
 for battery-driven settings,
 we include metrics to measure how workload execution impact smartphone battery levels.
 As per the computing capability shown in our experiments,
 we conclude that edge computing based on smartphone clusters can help in providing valuable computing resources to enable the expansion of AI in application scenarios requiring real-time responses.

 Dew Computing has two modes of operation,
 local mode and global mode.
 In local mode,
 services are provided by Dew Servers with resources that can be accessed within the scope of a local area network.
 By contrast,
 the global operation mode involves reaching Cloud servers to mitigate limitations of resource-constrained local nodes.
 Rendered services can be storage or computing capabilities.

 we focus on evaluating collaboration among consumer devices to perform Cloud-agnostic computing services for real-time execution of computer vision tasks using

.
 Under the vertical scheme,
 collaborating nodes typically belong to different computing layers
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738242603
 of the edge architecture
\change_unchanged
.
 These layers are organized in a hierarchical structure where nodes in a layer render services to those in the layer below using services provided by nodes in the layer above.
 Nodes at the base of such hierarchy commonly have much less powerful computing capabilities and use the services of layers above to complete compute intensive tasks.
 On the other side,
 nodes at the top layer present more powerful computing capabilities,
 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738242642
like Fog or Cloud resources.

owever,
 reaching such nodes incur in long-latency communication when transferring task input/output data.
 For this reason,
 its usage should be carefully analyzed specially for applications with delay-sensitive time constrains.
 A classical example of this type of collaboration is given when a resource-limited user device leverages the services of an Edge server or Edge layer to partially o completely compute the result of inference tasks.
 Since the Edge layer can render computing services to a variable number of users in a locality,
 depending on the burden at the time of receiving tasks,
 the Edge layer can have enough resources to complete or partially perform a task.
 In the later case,
 the Edge layer would eventually leverage the services of a remote Cloud datacenter to fullfill the request while meeting potential task deadlines.

 Several works evidence that vertical collaboration is feasible to allow resource-limited devices to execute compute-intensive tasks,
 such as CV tasks using large DNN models.
 However,
 a major drawback relates to the long-latency communication dependency when offloading tasks to upper resource layers that provide the required computing capability to complete the tasks.

Another inference distribution scheme is when nodes within the same layer collaborate in the execution of compute intensive tasks.
 This scheme is known as

 collaboration.
 A key difference with vertical collaboration is that participating nodes and data rarely occurs outside the scope of a LAN or WLAN.

.
 Within the former group,
 layers composing a DNN model are deployed into different devices so that outputs computed by a device are 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243028
the 
\change_unchanged
inputs for 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243030
an
\change_unchanged
other
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243031
 one
\change_unchanged
.
 With this type of parallelism,
 all participating devices are involved in computing inferences for all portions of the input.
 By contrast,
 when using 
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738243042
a 
\change_unchanged
data partitioning paralellism,
 edge nodes run the whole model over portions of the input.
 With both type of parallelisms,
 results for the whole input are obtained by joining partial results calculated by all participating devices.

 which leads to reduced memory footprint and allow resource limited devices to contribute with the computation of partial results that are combined to produce the final result of an inference task.

ly by a group of edge devices.
 With this scheme,
 inference capabilities differences of participating devices are handled with two strategies.
 One of these is static and represented by the fact that memory requirements of fused layers executed by a device adapts to its available memory resources.
 The other strategy is that data regions are dynamically distributed according to devices computing capabilities by following a work stealing scheme.

 Tasks,
 determined by images input size,
 and the DNN model to be used,
 are divided into sub-images and sub-models by a decision maker component that coordinates different pieces execution among end devices using a shared dependency table and real-time nodes information.
 Edge data duplication is present at the step of dividing an image into sub-images.
 When distributing a convolutional operation by dividing the input and the model,
 duplication is required for ensuring results correcteness.

 devices,
 such as smartphones,

\change_unchanged
 are yet unknown.
 Our work sheds light on providing empirical evidence for quantifying the computing power of smartphone clusters.
 Existing approaches exploiting data partitioning schemes add redundant data to the original input for performing distributed inference.
 We propose a simple yet effective data partitioning scheme for performing real-time CV tasks
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243747
,

\change_unchanged
 which is evaluated under varying settings of real smartphones cooperating in WLAN clusters.
 Since performance 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243755
may 
\change_unchanged
vary according to how workload is distributed,
 we provide insights on the performance achieved and energy-related measurements using different state-of-the-art online heuristics and smartphone clusters.
 Moreover,
 performance comparisons of different <smartphone clusters,
 load balancing heuristics> combinations were compared against the peformance achieved by different edge nodes commonly used in IoT applications.
 All experiments performed in this work demonstrate the viability of constructing a platform for in-vivo experiments whose main components has been previously published,
 validated and made publicly available for use.

\begin_layout Standard
We assume a master-worker architecture operating within the scope of WLAN,
 with a master node officiating as tasks submitter and worker nodes contributing with computing resources,
 i.e.,
 playing the role of tasks executors.
 A master node is assigned 
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738245703
with 
\change_unchanged
the roles of data concentrator and tasks coordinator.
 Playing the first role implies that the node exposes end points for receiving raw data and preprocessed data.
 On one side,
 raw data transfer
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738245725
r
\change_unchanged
ed to a master node is captured by devices with sensing capabilities,
 e.g.,
 RGB,
 IR or depth images taken with different camera devices.
 On the other side,
 preprocessed data is obtained by applying a series of computational operations to decode,
 synthetize
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738245746
d
\change_unchanged
 and/or represent raw data in a format that can be more efficiently stored,

y
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738245752

zed.
 Moreover,
 playing the role of tasks coordinator means that the node runs logic to decide
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738245777
s
\change_unchanged
 how to 
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738245797
apportion or 
\change_unchanged
distribute the load involved in preprocessing raw data by available worker nodes to meet the expected QoS.
 Finally,
 worker nodes opportunistically connected to the

\change_unchanged
LAN
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738245840
 where a master node operates,

 register through a master node service to contribute with computing resources and wait for tasks assigned by the master node.
 As tasks completion occurs
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738245858
 at the worker nodes
\change_unchanged
,
 results are sent back to the master node.

 tasks inference process does not.

 We call this latter inference latency.

 This is also true for

ther observation when comparing smartphone-based setups is that in general pull-based load balancing scheme achieves lower accumulated inference latency than

 This is because using pull-based allow the

- Workers full exploitation:
 as CPU profiles of experiments run reveal,
 CPU utilization is not full.
 Even though flags,
 such as XNNPACK,
 ncnn,
 are presented as accelerators to better exploit CPU capabilities,
 the technology is applied only to tensorflow framework.
 A library agnostic solution that consider not only better exploitation of CPU but also maximum CPU usage configured by end users would signify another relevant step towards a middleware that make mobile distribute computing a reality.

\change_unchanged
- Explore workers exploitation by considering model anatomy and workers capability:
 for prediction and/or classification tasks using deep learning,
 one or several models can be utilized.
 Each model migh differ in their number of layers.
 The model,
 in turn,
 can be splitted into different groups of layers where each group can be assigned to nodes with different computing and/or transferring capabilities in order to improve the inference time.
 Similar point of improvements can be thought for the application of ensemble learning techniques where the final output to a prediction or classification task is built by averaging partial outputs of different weak models.
 In this sense,
 and considering that weak models differ in their anatomy and output quality,
 heavy models can be deployed in high capable devices,
 while lighter models on low capable devices.
 How to rate a device as high or low capable is challenging due to the,
 device connection unstability,
 heterogeneous hardware,
 owner usage,
 i.e.,
 the high dynamic nature of device clusters.
