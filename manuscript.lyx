Gradually,
 
\change_unchanged
AI is becoming ubiquitous at the network edge.
 The wide availability of pre-trained models and AI execution frameworks are,
 in part,
 responsible of such ubiquity.
 Particularly,
 deep neural networks (DNL) such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) are extensively used in computer vision (CV) for performing object recognition and image classification tasks.
 Solutions in various domains ranging from security surveillance to e-health

 computer vision tasks.
 In many cases,
 such solutions must

 real-time inferences and some progress has been made in this respect.
 Some approaches show a strong dependency on Cloud resources as complement to the computing power that resource limited edge nodes can offer.
 Other solutions distribute workload horizontally,
 i.e.,
 by harnessing the power of several edge nodes within the same LAN or WLAN.
 Many of these efforts experiment with real settings comprising SBC-like edge nodes only such as NVidia Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi,
 and few of these consider nomadic hardware such as smartphones as edge nodes.
 Given the ubiquity of smartphones worldwide and the unlimited scenarios where clusters of these nodes can be exploited for providing su

stantial computing power,
 in this work,
 we shed some light in answering the following question:
 Is smartphone-based edge computing a competitive resource provider for real-time AI inferences?
 We evaluate the potential of smartphone clusters for making real-time inferences associated to CV tasks based on intuitive image/video partitioning schemes.
 In our experiments we use three pre-trained DNL models that present different computing requirements and eight heterogeneous edge nodes including five low/mid-end smartphones and three SBCs.
 We compared the performance achieved using workloads 
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738241517
that simulate
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738241517
from
\change_unchanged
 three image stream processing scenarios with different characteristics.
 Experiments were run with the help of a tool set 
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738241541
specially 
\change_unchanged
designed for reproducing battery-driven edge computing tests.
 We compared the 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738241552
task 
\change_unchanged
throughput achieved by using either several smartphone clusters testbeds or SBCs only.
 Additionally,
 for battery-driven settings,
 we include metrics to measure how workload execution impact smartphone battery levels.
 As per the computing capability shown in our experiments,
 we conclude that edge computing based on smartphone clusters can help in providing valuable computing resources to enable the expansion of AI in application scenarios requiring real-time responses.

 Dew Computing has two modes of operation,
 local mode and global mode.
 In local mode,
 services are provided by Dew Servers with resources that can be accessed within the scope of a local area network.
 By contrast,
 the global operation mode involves reaching Cloud servers to mitigate limitations of resource-constrained local nodes.
 Rendered services can be storage or computing capabilities.

 we focus on evaluating collaboration among consumer devices to perform Cloud-agnostic computing services for real-time execution of computer vision tasks using

.
 Under the vertical scheme,
 collaborating nodes typically belong to different computing layers
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738242603
 of the edge architecture
\change_unchanged
.
 These layers are organized in a hierarchical structure where nodes in a layer render services to those in the layer below using services provided by nodes in the layer above.
 Nodes at the base of such hierarchy commonly have much less powerful computing capabilities and use the services of layers above to complete compute intensive tasks.
 On the other side,
 nodes at the top layer present more powerful computing capabilities,
 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738242642
like Fog or Cloud resources.

owever,
 reaching such nodes incur in long-latency communication when transferring task input/output data.
 For this reason,
 its usage should be carefully analyzed specially for applications with delay-sensitive time constrains.
 A classical example of this type of collaboration is given when a resource-limited user device leverages the services of an Edge server or Edge layer to partially o completely compute the result of inference tasks.
 Since the Edge layer can render computing services to a variable number of users in a locality,
 depending on the burden at the time of receiving tasks,
 the Edge layer can have enough resources to complete or partially perform a task.
 In the later case,
 the Edge layer would eventually leverage the services of a remote Cloud datacenter to fullfill the request while meeting potential task deadlines.

 Several works evidence that vertical collaboration is feasible to allow resource-limited devices to execute compute-intensive tasks,
 such as CV tasks using large DNN models.
 However,
 a major drawback relates to the long-latency communication dependency when offloading tasks to upper resource layers that provide the required computing capability to complete the tasks.

Another inference distribution scheme is when nodes within the same layer collaborate in the execution of compute intensive tasks.
 This scheme is known as

 A key difference with vertical collaboration is that participating nodes and data rarely occurs outside the scope of a LAN or WLAN.

.
 Within the former group,
 layers composing a DNN model are deployed into different devices so that outputs computed by a device are 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243028
the 
\change_unchanged
inputs for 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243030
an
\change_unchanged
other
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243031
 one
\change_unchanged
.
 With this type of parallelism,
 all participating devices are involved in computing inferences for all portions of the input.
 By contrast,
 when using 
\change_deleted 1518850539 1738243042
a 
\change_unchanged
data partitioning paralellism,
 edge nodes run the whole model over portions of the input.
 With both type of parallelisms,
 results for the whole input are obtained by joining partial results calculated by all participating devices.

 With this scheme,
 inference capabilities differences of participating devices are handled with two strategies.
 One of these is static and represented by the fact that memory requirements of fused layers executed by a device adapts to its available memory resources.
 The other strategy is that data regions are dynamically distributed according to devices computing capabilities by following a work stealing scheme.

 are divided into sub-images and sub-models by a decision maker component that coordinates different pieces execution among end devices using a shared dependency table and real-time nodes information.
 Edge data duplication is present at the step of dividing an image into sub-images.
 When distributing a convolutional operation by dividing the input and the model,
 duplication is required for ensuring results correcteness.

 are yet unknown.
 Our work sheds light on providing empirical evidence for quantifying the computing power of smartphone clusters.
 Existing approaches exploiting data partitioning schemes add redundant data to the original input for performing distributed inference.
 We propose a simple yet effective data partitioning scheme for performing real-time CV tasks

 which is evaluated under varying settings of real smartphones cooperating in WLAN clusters.
 Since performance 
\change_inserted 1518850539 1738243755
may 
\change_unchanged
vary according to how workload is distributed,
 we provide insights on the performance achieved and energy-related measurements using different state-of-the-art online heuristics and smartphone clusters.
 Moreover,
 performance comparisons of different <smartphone clusters,
 load balancing heuristics> combinations were compared against the peformance achieved by different edge nodes commonly used in IoT applications.
 All experiments performed in this work demonstrate the viability of constructing a platform for in-vivo experiments whose main components has been previously published,
 validated and made publicly available for use.

We envision a system that opportunistically scavenges computing cycles of nomadic hardware,
 such as smartphones,
 to complement –or eventually replaced– the performance delivered by low power edge nodes.
 Particularly,
 we shed light on the computing capability of different smartphone clusters and load balancing heuristics for processing streams,
 in this work,
 of images to complete CV tasks in realtime or near realtime by harnessing deep neural networks.
 Definition of appropriate incentives to smartphone users –tasks executors–,
 privacy preservation and security mechanisms for tasks submitters as for tasks executors,
 are outside the scope of the current work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume a master-worker architecture operating within the scope of WLAN,
 with a master node officiating as tasks submitter and worker nodes contributing with computing resources,
 i.e.,
 playing the role of tasks executors.
 A master node is assigned with the roles of data concentrator and tasks coordinator.
 Playing the first role implies that the node exposes end points for receiving raw data and preprocessed data.
 On one side,
 raw data transfered to a master node is captured by devices with sensing capabilities,
 e.g.,
 RGB,
 IR or depth images taken with different camera devices.
 On the other side,
 preprocessed data is obtained by applying a series of computational operations to decode,
 synthetized and/or represent raw data in a format that can be more efficiently stored,
 retrieved or analized.
 Moreover,
 playing the role of tasks coordinator means that the node runs logic to decides how to apportion or distribute the load involved in preprocessing raw data by available worker nodes to meet the expected QoS.
 Finally,
 worker nodes opportunistically connected to the LAN where a master node operates,
 register through a master node service to contribute with computing resources and wait for tasks assigned by the master node.
 As tasks completion occurs,
 results are sent back to the master node.

 All nodes have multicore processors and 802.11 WiFi radio that theoretically is able to reach bandwidth between hundreds of Mbps (norm n) to few Gbps (norm ac).
 Edge nodes main memory ranges from 2 to 8 Gb.
 In our setups,
 Single board computers (SBC) operate plugged to the electricity power grid,
 while smartphones operate using the battery as main power source.
 Additionally we included an estimated per unit adquisition cost in american dollars.
 When searching for cost-effective configurations,
 the cost can be used as indicator to untie situations where several nodes achieved the desired throughput.

 offers a benchmarking tool to collect statistical information of a
\family typewriter

\family default
 model.
 The tool measures the time a model takes to produce an inference,
 memory consumed among other information using synthetic input randomly generated.
 It worth mention that all inferences times reported in this paper are on the basis of using CPU support.
 Even though today there is especialized hardware,
 sometimes referred as AI hardware accelerators to run AI logic faster than with general purpose hardware like CPU,
 there are some practical limitations including library support for different platforms and propietary chips embeed only in high-end smartphones of certain brands that ralentless the massively use of mobile distributed computing as we envision.

The notion of real-time is context dependent and depending on the application an ever-present time delay of a few seconds satisfies the notion of real-time.
 For this reason and with the aim of evaluating smartphone based settings for potential different application scenarios,
 i.e.,
 with different real-time notions,
 we used three DNN models that present quite disimil inferences times.
 It not part of the evaluation core to test DNN models in their most efficient version,
 i.e.,
 we do not aim to test and improve models performance per se.
 Conversely,
 our objective is to compare the performance achieved with edge devices and smartphone based opportunistic clusters.

All models used in benchmark tests are pretrained models that take images as input and produce text as output,
 where text refers to bounding boxes,
 classes and confidence levels of recognized objects,
 or categories of a unique object depending on the purpose the model was trained for.
 To test different mobile distributed computing scenarios,
 we intentionally selected models that,
 when used to make inferences,
 present dismil computing time.
 In this sense,
 one of the models is YoloV4

 shows average inference times (in miliseconds) for different nodes when performing object detection using a YoloV4-tiny model ported to Tensorflow lite.
 We see,
 for instance,
 that a smartphone Xiaomi RN7 makes inferences in around 248 milliseconds,
 i.e.,
 is able to process up to 4 FPS which doubles the capability of a RaspberryPi4,
 but is slower than a Gigabyte Brix which reaches nearly 10 FPS.
 Other of the benchmarked models encapsulate expert knowledge in what is known as Body Condition Score (BCS)

 For instance,
 the Xiaomi RN7 smartphone completes an inference in around 184 milliseconds,

 is able to deliver barely more than 5 FPS,
 while a Gigabyte Brix node is around 15 FPS.

 shows the inferences times obtain by different edge nodes.
 By comparing the fastest smartphone with fastest SBC it can be noted that Xiaomi RN7 completes an inference in around 1470 milliseconds while a Gigabyte Brix does the same in approximately 559 milliseconds.
 When comparing performance of DNN models,
 notice that for most of the edge nodes benchmarks,
 inference times differ up to one order of magnitude.
 As said,
 a Xiaomi RN7 completes inferences in 184,
 248 and 1470 milliseconds for BCS model,
 yolov4 model and diabetes foot model respectively.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we describe workloads associated to machine vision tasks that must be performed over a stream-like input.
 Machine vision tasks such as object detection and classification using CNNs are commonly applied in diverse domains.
 To complete the experimental setting,
 we consider video frames streams of different lenght and distinct frame rate that serve as input to the CNN models described above and in conjuntion both things shape heterogeneous workloads to the mobile distributed computing setups under evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without loosing generality,
 we associate each model-stream pair different domain/usage contexts.
 These domains are:
 a smart city application scenario that we call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sense while Travel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 a dairy farm application scenario called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Body Condition Score
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and a human healthcare monitoring application scenario called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Desease Monitoring and Early Diagnosis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Next we describe the dynamics of each scenario that give sense to the stream-like input assumed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Body Condition Score Calculus (BCS):
 in a dairy farm,
 outfitted cows,
 i.e.,
 cows that are either overweighted or underweighted tend to produce less milk than those properly weighted.
 Identify such animals to give them a proper treatment is crucial to maintain the cow roundup fully productive.
 To classify such animals a CNN model is used which takes depth images taken from top of a cow with a camera strategically positioned
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "alvarez2018body"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The image capturing procedure is performed within a time window that not exceceds 10 seconds.
 During such time,
 providing that animals naturally don't state quite under the camera and the capture should contain a specific part of the cow,
 a high percent of captured images,
 let say 50%,
 are dropped,
 i.e.,
 tagged and filtered as not useful input for the CNN model.
 Moreover,
 during the transition of one animal to the next under the lens of camera,
 which can take 10 seconds in average,
 it is proper to stop capturing images.
 To make the body condition score calculus feasible,
 realiable,
 and energy effienct it is proper to count with no less than a hundred of frames ready to serve as input for the CNN model,
 from each cow.
 All these constraints configure a stream processing scenario where depth images can be produced at a rate of 15 FPS during 10 seconds,
 followed by other 10 seconds without images captures.
 We determined that an atomic CV task woud be represented by the burden of applying the CNN model to fiftheen consecutive frames,
 meaning that a CV task is created every second which gives a total of ten CV tasks created for a cow.
 Considering that the dataset used to simulate this scenario includes 1740 images,
 the resulting workload stream comprises 116 CV tasks given within a time window of 3' minutes and 34'' seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sense while Travel (SWT):
 a city can take advantage of mobile agents such as urban line buses to collect information of relevant street events while traveling,
 e.g.,
 for statistical purposes,
 crime detection,
 infrastructure maintenance planning,
 etc.
 Images captured with a bus front camera might feed a YOLO model which gives a plain text representation of objects present in an image and the accuracy percentage of each detected object class as output.
 An energy eficient way to achieve this without having to process a large amount of frames with redundant information,
 is to cleverly select a sample rate accordingly with the expected moving change of detection target.
 We assume this sample rate in 2 FPS and evaluate the system performance for a stream duration of 30 minutes.
 These parameters equates approximately to sense data of 15 km of a road assuming a vehicle travelling at 30 km/h.
 A CV task would be represented by the application of the CNN model to two consecutive filtered frames,
 meaning that a CV task is created every second.
 Providing that the dataset used to simulate this scenario includes 3600 images,
 the resulting workload stream comprises 1800 CV tasks given within a time window of 30' minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disease Monitoring and Early Diagnosis (DMED):
 We envision a remote monitoring m-health scenario where a CNN model encapsulates expert knowledge on different patologies to allow people,
 e.g.,
 older people receiving intensive care services,
 to analize different health parameters as a way to prevent the appearance of some pathology or monitoring a pre-existence illnees.
 We assume an scenario where a caregiver or nurse rendering services in an eldery residence is assigned with the task of taking pictures of all patients foot tissue resulting in a data stream of 10 FPS during 2 seconds with pauses of 7 seconds without images capturing.
 In this case,
 a CV task is represented by the burden of applying the model described in
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bergoeing2023exploring"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to 2 consecutive frames,
 meaning that during image capturing time,
 five CV tasks are created per second.
 Providing that the dataset used to simulate this scenario incluides 600 images,
 the resulting workload stream comprises 300 CV tasks given within a time window of 8' minutes and 55'' seconds.

Irrespective of the domain,
 these application example scenarios present streams with different characteristics not only by the dynamics of input generation but also the computing capability required to perform inferences.
 In addition,
 it is assumed that inferences results should be available at the master node with minimun latency,
 i.e.,
 as close as possible to a real-time.

One of the metrics we report is accumulated inference latency.
 To calculate accumulated inference latency,
 we measure how long the makespan deviates from the stream time.
 The stream time is the time window where CV tasks are created,
 while makespan is the time the inference system employs in completing all CV tasks created.

 graphically represents how these entities coexist in time.
 Inference completion of a task naturally occurs in time after the CV task creation.
 While tasks creation could occur by following a quite controlled and periodically process,
 tasks inference process does not.
 This is what 
\begin_inset Formula $α,β,γ,δ,ε,ζ$
\end_inset

 represent in the CV tasks inference timeline associated to each CV task completion event,
 i.e.,
 different completion times that could be given as consequence but not limited to variations in network latency,
 CNN data input content and nodes execution capability.
 When substracting stream time to makespan,
 the result is the accumulated inference latency.
 The nearest this difference to zero,
 the better the setup capabililty is to respond with proper inferences time compared to the time taken to create all CV tasks.
 A derived metric which gives a notion of the average time employed by the setup to complete a CV task after a new CV task is available,
 could be obtained dividing the accumulated inference latency by the number of CV tasks created.
 We call this latter inference latency.

Other metric we report is total energy consumption.
 To measure energy consumption we followed two approches depending on the type of setup.
 For SBC-based setups we employ a power monitor that using a toroid connected as shown in Figure

 allow us to collect current and voltage readings from an SBC in a non-invasive way while running workloads.
 The power monitor is connected to the 220V AC power and it has a socket after a toroid where the SBC power source is connected.
 Current and Voltage readings are transmitted in real-time via a usb port to a laptop.
 The power monitor gives two current and voltage values per second.
 Then,
 for a workload scenario whose inference time is around 3' minutes 50'' seconds,
 the reported energy consumption is obtained by averaging 460 samples.

Since for smartphone based setups the described approach for registering energy consumpution is not practical,
 because smartphone batteries are used as power source,
 we employed a different approach.
 We registered smartphones battery levels at the begining and at the end of a workload scenario.
 Then,
 we used battery manufacturer information,
 such as battery mAh and operating voltage,
 of each smartphone to approximate the total energy used during the workload scenario execution (WSE).
 The following is an example of such calculus expressed in Joules:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
WSEJoules=\sum_{i=0}^{\#smartphones}(battLevelDrops^{i}*battMAh^{i}*0.01)*battVoltage^{i}*3.6
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\#smartphones$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the amount of smartphones integrating the cluster,
 
\begin_inset Formula $battLevelDrops^{i}$
\end_inset

is the amount of battery level drops the smartphone 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 used for executing the assigned workload,
 which is in turn calculated as:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
battLevelDrops=batt_{endWSE}-batt_{startWSE}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $batt_{startWSE}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $batt_{endWSE}$
\end_inset

 are the battery level of smartphone 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at the start and end of the workload scenario execution respectively,
 
\begin_inset Formula $battMah^{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $battVoltage^{i}$
\end_inset

 are milli-amperes hour and operating voltage information respectively,
 provided by the battery manufacturer of smartphone 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Formula
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1 emerges from combining a rule of three that relates battery percentage usage with the unit convertion formula from mAh to Joules which is 
\begin_inset Formula $mAh*voltage*3.6=JoulesOfenergy$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally,
 since a workload scenario execution using smartphone based setups might cause different battery percentage usage on each node,
 we report Jain's fairness index
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jain1984quantitative"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 as a metric that sumarizes intra-cluster energy utilization.
 In other words,
 the metric is used to measure the disparity of energy pulled by the system from resource provider nodes.
 The metric takes values from 0 to 1.
 The nearest the index to value of one the more balanced the energy utilization between nodes is.
 The Jain's index applied formula is expressed as following,
 where :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Fairness=\frac{\left[\sum_{i=0}^{\#smartphones}battLevelDrops^{i}\right]^{2}}{\#smartphones*\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\#smartphones}\left[(battLevelDrops^{i})\right]^{2}\right)}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
Since all smartphone-based setups comprise clusters of at least two heterogenous smartphones,
 it was necesary to indicate the load balancing strategy used to distribute load.
 For this reason,
 all smartphone-based setups are indicated with Round Robin or Pull-Based as value in the load balancing column.
 Round Robin is a classic load balancing strategy that assigns an incomming job to the next available node in a rotating sequence,
 ensuring workload is evently distributed among all participating devices.
 By contrast,
 with a Pull-Based approach jobs are pulled by nodes from a shared queue based on their availability.
 In our configurations,
 nodes were configured to pull at most one job per request.
 In turn,
 a node is able to make a request when the result of the previouly pulled job was sent back to the proxy i.e.,
 the job is marked by the system as complete.

 shows the performance achieved by all setups for all scenarios.
 Blue bars correspond to SBC-based setups while orange ones to smartphone-based setups.
 By comparing all setups,
 it can be clearly note that the best performance,
 i.e.,
 the lowest accumulated inference latency value in all tested scenarios is achieved with the Gigabyte Brix setup.
 The close to zero value indicates that inference service performed with this setup is near to real-time,
 i.e.,
 inference results to all CV tasks are obtained within the stream time.
 Concretely,
 in the BCS scenario,
 the accumulated latency in a stream time of 3' 50'' was 3 seconds.
 In the SWT scenario,
 the accumulated latency in a stream time of 30' was 1.2 seconds while in the DMED scenario with a stream time of 8'55'',
 the value for same metric was 3.6 seconds.
 With the Raspberry Pi4 and Nvidia Jetson Nano setups the accumulated inference latency was significantly greater than with the Gigabyte Brix setup.
 In most cases,
 the inference latency was the stream time multiplied by a factor of two to four.
 The Nvidia Jetson nano setups performed better than the Raspberry Pi4 setups in all cases.
 However,
 the workload always overpassed the inference capability.
 Reducing workload would be necessary with these setups to achieve a near to real-time performace.
 Some alternatives to reduce workload are creating lightweight CV tasks by dropping frames and/or offloading some CV tasks to other Edge nodes.
 These alternatives could come,
 in turn,
 with some QoS degradation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When comparing smartphone-based setups for BCS scenario,
 we confirm what several simulated studies conclude that is by incrementing the number of participating smartphones,
 performance improves,
 i.e,
 lower accumulated inference latency is obtained.
 This is also true for SWT and DMED scenarios.
 However,
 not only the number of smartphones impact on the setup inference service capability,
 the smartphones computing characteristics also affect.
 Clusters 301 and 302,
 for instance,
 are of the same size.
 Both clusters are composed by a Samsung A30 and a Motorola Moto G9 play.
 However,
 the Samsung A02 smartphone present in Cluster 302 is not present in Cluster 301 which has a Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 instead.
 If we compared the inference times associated to the latter mentioned smartphone models reported in Figures

\end_inset

,
 we will note that the computing capability of the Samsung A02 is in between 2.62 and 3.99 times slower than that of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7.
 The effect of such difference is observed in the performance values registered for the SWT scenario where both clusters are tested.
 While the accumulated inference latency with Cluster 301 was in between 
\begin_inset Formula $\backsim$
\end_inset

16 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\backsim$
\end_inset

31 seconds,
 with Cluster 302 it was in between 
\begin_inset Formula $\backsim$
\end_inset

131 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\backsim$
\end_inset

678 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other observation when comparing smartphone-based setups is that in general pull-based load balancing scheme achieves lower accumulated inference latency than when using round robin.
 This is because using pull-based allow the system to balance the workload in accordance to the availability and computing capability of worker nodes rather than treat all nodes with the same capability as round robin does.
 This advantage of pull-based over round robin dinimishes in clusters where nodes present quite similar computing capability,
 which is the case of Cluster 202 in SWT scenario or even when computing resources are apparently abundant resources for satisfying the workload requirements which seems to be the case of Cluster 408.
 In general,
 the most competitive accumulated inference latency comparison to that obtained by the Gigabyte Brix setup was always achieved with a pull-based load balancing scheme.
 For example,
 in the BCS scenario,
 the difference between Cluster 409 and Gigabyte Brix setups was less than 8 seconds which is,
 in turn,
 seven times shorter than the second best setup.
 A similar analysis is valid in the SWT and in DMED scenarios,
 with the Clusters 408 and 411 respectively.
 This load balancing scheme achieves considerable better performance than round robin when clusters nodes present heterogeneous computing capabilities and resource scarcity.

 reports the energy consumption and accumulated inference latency tradeoff between different setups in each tested scenario.
 The best setups are those that achieve the minimun accumulated inference latency using the least energy,
 i.e.,
 those positioned close to the origin.
 As can be observed in all scenarios,
 the best balance is always achieved by orange dots with a label starting with Cl which corresponds to smartphone-based setups.
 It can be noted,
 for instance,
 that the accumulated inference latency of GBx setups are the lowest in bcs,
 swt and dmed scenarios,
 however,
 these are also associated to the highest values of energy utilization.
 Moreover,
 the slowest setups are not necesary associated to the most convenient in terms of energy consumption.
 Interestingly,
 smartphone-based setups,
 particularly size four clusters using pull-based as load balancing scheme offer a good tradeoff in all scenarios,
 i.e.,
 competitive performance with the least energy consumption.
 These are the cases of Cl409-PB,
 Cl408-PB and Cl411-PB for BCS,
 SWT and DMED scenarios respectively.
 In other words,
 for the BCS scenario,
 when it is acceptable that all CV tasks results were calculated with a delay of 7.8 seconds w.r.t to the fastest setup,
 then the Cluster 409 setup with pull-based scheme can achieve the objetive by utilizing 
\begin_inset Formula $\backsim$
\end_inset

1510 Joules,
 i.e.,
 almost three times less energy than by using the Gigabyte Brix setup.
 Similar relations can be found for SWT and DMED scenarios.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Battery utilization analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For smartphone-based setups,
 it is relevant to show the impact of CV tasks computation on clusters energy availability.
 Providing that clusters are composed of at least two nodes,
 cluster battery can be seen as the aggregation of nodes battery.
 To represent the cluster current battery level with a single positive integer value,
 we aggregate the Joules each smartphone contributes to the global cluster energy.
 By assuming that a cluster with 100% global battery level is one where batteries of all integrating smartphones are fully charged,
 using equation 1 it is possible to know which is the global battery level expressed in percentage of a cluster for different smartphones battery levels.
 Then,
 figure

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 shows global battery level drops for all smartphone-based setups evaluated in all scenarios.
 Since in all cases smartphone-based setups run workloads tests unplugged from the electricity grid,
 i.e.,
 with batteries in discharging mode,
 the battery drops were calculated as the diference between the initial and the final global battery level of a cluster before and after the workload execution respectively.
 In figure

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Global-battery-impact"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 it can be noted,
 for instance,
 that CV tasks of SWT scenario causes the highest global battery drops compared to BCS and DMED which is mainly due to the lenght of the workload execution -30' compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $\backsim$
\end_inset

4' and 
\begin_inset Formula $\backsim$
\end_inset

9' in BCS and DMED respectively-.

\begin_layout Standard
Other observation that emerges from figure

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is that when comparing cluster battery level drop between clusters of the same scenario,
 it seems to decrease as the cluster size increases.
 In fact,
 as more smartphones integrate a cluster the cluster battery also increases and one percentage of such cluster battery is represented by a bigger number in Joules.
 Something similar happens when two clusters are of the same size but one has smartphones whose batteries have more energy storage capacity than the other which is the case of Cl301 and Cl302.
 However,
 a cluster with a bigger battery does not imply that it will complete tasks in a more energy efficient way.
 As example,
 refer to Max.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 to see that Cl302 has slightly bigger cluster battery capacity than Cl301,
 because a Xiaomi RN7 with a battery capacity of 4000 mAh in Cl301 was replaced by a Samsung A02 with a battery capacity of 4900 mAh in Cl302.
 However,
 according to Figure
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:YoloV4-benchmarking"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 the latter smartphone is almost four times slower to perform a task from the SWT scenario than the former,
 meaning that Cl302 will spent more energy than Cl301 in completing the same amount of tasks.
 This explains why despite having a bigger cluster battery,
 the battery drop of Cl302 is bigger than that of Cl301 in SWT scenario showed in Figure

.
 Moreover,
 it is relevant to point out that,
 in general,
 pull-based load balancing scheme achieves equal or less global battery drops than round robin in approximately 0.5 percentage.

Finally,
 we analyze fairness values derived from applying round robin and pull-based load balancing schemes.
 The index serves as a hint on how the system utilize energy from all smartphones integrating a cluster.
 As the value approximates to one the more balanced the battery utilization is.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 reveals that in some clusters,
 pull-based scheme achieves slightly higher fairness values than that of round robin,
 while in other cases,
 the results are in the other way around.
 There are cases where even both achieves equal fairness values.
 Since there is not clear pattern of one compared to the other load balancing scheme,
 we can conclude that there is not a clear better load balancing attending the fairness aspect.

Conclusions and future works

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we explored the computing capabilities for real-time inferences of mobile distributed computing setups by experimenting with heterogeneous workloads built upon real CNN models and images data sets that were used to emulate CV tasks generated in a stream-like manner.
 Puntually,
 we run and compare the performance achieved by several setups built with commodity hardware including SBCs and smartphone clusters that could be found or exploited in edge computing and IoT application scenarios.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude that tiny clusters composed by 2-4 low to middle-end smartphones using a pull-based load balancing scheme offer competitive performance compared to an SBC equiped with an intel core i5 8th generation in computing real-time inferences of CV tasks.
 It suggests that to satisfy certain delay sensitive application scenarios,
 the exploitation of already-in-place smartphones clusters can be considered before the investment and deployment of SBCs.
 In addition,
 energy consumption measurements show that the tradeoff including performance and energy consumption favors smartphone clusters over SBCs.
 The former can deliver competitive performance with a reduction of around tree times the energy consumption spent by a Gigabyte Brix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As future works we visualize several points of improvements.
 In line with developing new load balancing heuristics,
 and based on results of preliminary runs we plan to improve previously published heuristics that use MFLOPs to rank nodes computing capability.
 An alternative is to use information derived from Tensorflow benchmarking tool.
 In spite of differences observed in inference times obtained via tensorflow benchmarking tool and results collected in experiments using real input,
 relative benchmarked positions between edge nodes are similar,
 meaning that it is feasible to use such tool to build node rankings that serve as input for the load balancing component to distribute jobs based on an alternative nodes performance score to the classic MFLOPs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other future direction is to consider other forms of workload distributions,
 i.e.,
 that exploit the structure of DNN arquitectures,
 for example,
 split computing,
 early exiting techniques,
 model quantization;
 other forms of workload execution,
 e.g,
 using flags that reduce the inference time,
 e.g,
 make inferences over a batch of images,
 or accelerators such as the XNNPACK support to better exploit CPU capabilities of mobile platforms while performing network inferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More improvements to the distributed execution system prototype that integrate smartphones are in the line of refinining aspects such as:
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

- Workers full exploitation:
 as CPU profiles of experiments run reveal,
 CPU utilization is not full.
 Even though flags,
 such as XNNPACK,
 ncnn,
 are presented as accelerators to better exploit CPU capabilities,
 the technology is applied only to tensorflow framework.
 A library agnostic solution that consider not only better exploitation of CPU but also maximum CPU usage configured by end users would signify another relevant step towards a middleware that make mobile distribute computing a reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Explore workers exploitation by considering model anatomy and workers capability:
 for prediction and/or classification tasks using deep learning,
 one or several models can be utilized.
 Each model migh differ in their number of layers.
 The model,
 in turn,
 can be splitted into different groups of layers where each group can be assigned to nodes with different computing and/or transferring capabilities in order to improve the inference time.
 Similar point of improvements can be thought for the application of ensemble learning techniques where the final output to a prediction or classification task is built by averaging partial outputs of different weak models.
 In this sense,
 and considering that weak models differ in their anatomy and output quality,
 heavy models can be deployed in high capable devices,
 while lighter models on low capable devices.
 How to rate a device as high or low capable is challenging due to the,
 device connection unstability,
 heterogeneous hardware,
 owner usage,
 i.e.,
 the high dynamic nature of device clusters.
